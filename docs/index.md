# Gopiandcode's Reddit Slideshow (unofficial)
## A small UWP slideshow application.
![The Application Logo][logo]

Brighten up your device with a flashy dynamic wallpaper slideshow, sourced straight from the front page of the internet - Reddit!

Jokes aside, feels good to finally ship the thing - It's just been approved on the Windows market, and should soon be accessible to everyone. The version on this repo is actually slightly ahead of the released one, as it has subreddit saving/loading functionality.

## Screenshots
![Landing Page][landingpage]

The Landing page for the application. The Logo positioning has been ~~frustratingly~~ carefully adjusted to look good on all sizes.

![Image View Page][imageviewpage]

How the actual slideshow looks. Potentially in the future I'll make the icons fade on a lack of mouse movement.

![Options Page][optionspage]

Selecting options - also notice the blur effect on the image. Took me friggen ages to get right.

Ahh man. Looks so good to have it on a start page like a real application!

## Deployment Instructions
Seeing as this __is opensource__, I thought I'd add a couple of deployment instructions for if you guys want to modify it yourself.
1. You must have the Universal Windows App Development Toolkit. This can be installed from the Visual Studio Community/Express installer.
2. Open the vs project in visual studio.
Done!
